# mephaBot
Little Discord Bot that I use to play radio streams and other random stuff.

At the moment all it basically does is taking radio stations from a file and using the URL to stream it to a specified voice channel.

##Command list so far: 

- !shrug: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- !bot: Connects to the predefined channel
- !RADIOSHORT: Plays the radio station as defined in the config file. 


##radio.cfg structure

Each line represents one station. Three fields have to be provided separated by a coma:
shortName, URL, longName

The fields are separated using a ', ' which is important.
